'''
If someone **loves** a flower, of which just _one single blossom_ grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to maake him happy just to
look at the stars. He can say to himself, "Somewhere, my flower is there..." But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened...
And you think that is not important!
